This repository is dedicated to the work done throughout a digital design course at my university.

These laboratories were developed by Xilinx, known as "HDL Design using Vivado"

My university uses Nexys FPGA boards, however I bought a Basys 3 board to verify the designs on my own time, and be able to expand my knowledge outside of the course.
